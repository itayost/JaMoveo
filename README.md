# JaMoveo

A real-time collaborative music rehearsal application for Moveo's jam sessions.

## Project Overview

JaMoveo is a web application designed to enhance music rehearsals by allowing musicians to view synchronized song lyrics and chords from their mobile devices. The application enables an admin user to search for songs and display them to all connected musicians, with content tailored to each musician's instrument.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Register with your instrument type and log in securely
- **Role-based Content**: Singers see lyrics, instrumentalists see chords and lyrics
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Admin controls what everyone sees simultaneously
- **Auto-scroll Functionality**: Hands-free scrolling for active playing
- **Mobile-Optimized Interface**: Designed for use on phones in rehearsal settings
- **High-Contrast Display**: Readable interface even in smoky rehearsal rooms
- **Multi-language Support**: Song search and display in both English and Hebrew

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Socket.io client, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jamoveo.git
cd jamoveo
```

### 2. Install root dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file from example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your configuration
# - Set a secure JWT_SECRET
# - Configure MongoDB connection
# - Set ADMIN_SIGNUP_CODE for admin registration

# Start the server in development mode
npm run dev
```

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to client directory (from project root)
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the client in development mode
npm start
```

### 5. Seed Initial Data

To populate the database with sample song data and create default users:

```bash
# From the server directory
npm run seed
```

This will create:
- A default admin user (username: admin, password: adminpassword)
- A default regular user (username: user, password: password)
- Sample songs in both English and Hebrew
