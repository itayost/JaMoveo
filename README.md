# JaMoveo

A real-time collaborative music rehearsal application that synchronizes song lyrics and chords across band members' devices.

## Overview

JaMoveo transforms traditional band rehearsals by providing a synchronized digital platform where musicians can view song lyrics and chords on their mobile devices. An admin controls what everyone sees in real-time, eliminating the need for paper sheets and ensuring everyone is literally on the same page.

## Features

### For Musicians
- **Instrument-Based Registration**: Sign up with your specific instrument (guitar, bass, drums, vocals, keyboard, saxophone, or other)
- **Role-Based Content**: Vocalists see only lyrics, while instrumentalists see both lyrics and chords
- **Auto-Scroll**: Hands-free scrolling with adjustable speed for uninterrupted playing
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility in smoky rehearsal environments
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Large fonts and touch-friendly interface designed for phones

### For Admins
- **Song Search**: Search through the song database in English or Hebrew
- **Real-Time Control**: Select songs that instantly appear on all connected devices
- **Session Management**: Create and control rehearsal sessions
- **Quit Functionality**: End songs and return all users to the waiting screen

### Technical Features
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Socket.io ensures zero-latency updates
- **Bilingual Support**: Proper RTL layout for Hebrew songs
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user sessions with role-based access
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all device sizes
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators for connection issues

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itayost/JaMoveo.git
   cd JaMoveo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   npm install

   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
   ```env
   # MongoDB Connection
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/jamoveo

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

   # Admin Registration Code
   ADMIN_SIGNUP_CODE=your-admin-code

   # Server Port
   PORT=5001

   # Client URL (for CORS)
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Seed the Database**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run seed
   ```
   This creates sample songs and default users.

5. **Start Development Servers**
   ```bash
   # From project root
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 5001).
